Scheduled Automatic Testing:
The test-suite is scheduled to run every three days, so you can see if the supermarket chains has chanced something in their interface and the package will not work probably. however, the tests running here are also integration tests with the APIs which may fail.

What is il_supermarket_scarper?
-------------

There are alot of projects in github trying to scrape the supermarket data, most of them are not stable or wasn't updated for a while, it's about time there will be one codebase that does the work completely. 

You only need to run the following code to get all the data currently shared by the supermarkets.

```python
from il_supermarket_scarper import MainScrapperRunner

scraper = MainScrapperRunner()
scraper.run()
```


Please notice!
since new files are constantly uploaded by the supermarket to their site, you will only get the current snapshot. In order to keep geting data, you will need to run this code more the one time to get the newly uploaded files. 

Quick start
-----------

il_supermarket_scarper can be installed using pip:

    python3 -m pip install -U il-supermarket-scraper

If you want to run the latest version of the code, you can install from the
repo directly:

    python3 -m pip install -U git+https://github.com/erlichsefi/israeli-supermarket-scarpers.git
    # or if you don't have 'git' installed
    python3 -m pip install -U https://github.com/erlichsefi/israeli-supermarket-scarpers/master
    


Running Docker
-----------
The docker is designed to run the scaper every 6 hours, (you change the cron expression if you would like, checkout the file 'crontab'), in every itreation the scraper will collect the files avaliabe to download and check if the file alreay exists before fetching it, either by scaning the dump folder, or checking the mongo.


    docker-compose up -d

or if you want to use the existing image from docker hub:

    docker pull erlichsefi/israeli-supermarket-scarpers:latest
